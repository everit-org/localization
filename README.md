localization
============

## Introduction

Localization contains OSGi modules that help using persistent
localized data. To do that, it stores the key-value pairs in
databse tables.

The solution also contains an API that helps building localized
queries or query parts.

The localization modules are developed based on the concept of
[modularized persistence][1].
